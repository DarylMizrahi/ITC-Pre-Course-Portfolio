                <p id="why-coding">After starting my career in the high-tech industry in a fast paced company where I
                    gained
                    more and more important over five years as a marketing manager,<br> I had the chance to work
                    alongside
                    developers and I quickly understood that coding will be the reading and writing of the future. I got
                    used to solving any <br> different types of problems and I absolutely adore it. I understood that
                    coding
                    will
                    give me a new way of looking at issue and shape my thinking process.</p>

                <p id="education-paragraph"> From Setpember 2012 to April 2013 I lived in New York where I studied
                    English through the English as Second Language program in a comminuty college. <br> During that time
                    I
                    passed the TOEFL test which allowed me to join the Interdisciplinary Center of Herzliya (IDC) that
                    same year in October. For three years I studied Interactive Communications and minored in
                    Entrepreneurship. <br> During that time, I got admitted in 2013-2014 to join the Pilot Networking
                    Project
                    (PNP) which is a program designed to create social and business <br> cooperation between both the
                    Israelis and the International Schools at the IDC. Only 10 studends from the Israeli school and from
                    the International school were accepted. During my second year, <br> I got accepted to the The "CO-OP
                    Startup Experience Course" which is an academic course that enables students to intern in a real
                    company for 10 weeks.<br> Students are involved in real hands-on projects and improve their skills,
                    knowledge and experience via "learning-by-doing. Those two experiences allowed me to network and
                    gain experience while receiving my degree. <br> During my last year of university, the
                    Entrepreneurship cluster provided students with the training, expertise, and resources needed to
                    launch <br> the next generation of successful Israeli ventures, while strengthening and cultivating
                    the
                    countryâ€™s startup ecosystem. It offers undergraduate and graduate-level <br> experiential learning
                    that
                    combines academics with hands-on entrepreneurship opportunities beyond the classroom. We worked with
                    teams of students from all over the world on developing idea and participating to a pitch
                    competition to present our end of the year project </p>
